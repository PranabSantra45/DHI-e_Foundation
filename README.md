# DHI-E Foundation Web Repository

This repository is dedicated to the **DHI-E Foundation** official website:  
üåê [www.dhi-e.org](https://www.dhi-e.org)

## About
DHI-e Foundation is a registered non-profit organization committed to empowering underserved communities through education, mentorship and digital outreach.

## Purpose of this Repository
Since the official website is hosted on **Wix**, the source code is not available here.  
Instead, this repository serves as:
-  A central hub for **website content** (text, blogs, mission statements).  
-  A storage space for **assets** (logos, images, graphics).  
-  **SEO keywords, meta tags**, and optimization guidelines.  
-  Documentation of updates, change logs, and planned features.  

## Contribution
This repository is managed by the technical team of DHI-e Foundation. 

Future contributions may include:
- Migrating the Wix site into a **React/Firebase site** for more flexibility.  
- Maintaining version control of blogs, assets and outreach content.
